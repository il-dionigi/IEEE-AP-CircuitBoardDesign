# Schematic and Board Design
*05 February 2018 (Schematic)*

*16 February 2018 (PCB)*

This repo contains both the schematic and board files for our PCB made using EAGLE.  

Creating the schematic and board involved the culmination of all previous labs, as each of the components and wiring setups were tested or designed by our group.

The specs for both parts can be found in [schematic-spec.pdf](https://github.com/il-dionigi/Circuit-Board-Design/blob/master/schematic-spec.pdf) and [board-spec.pdf](https://github.com/il-dionigi/Circuit-Board-Design/blob/master/schematic-spec.pdf) respectively. Screenshots of the schematic may be found [here](https://github.com/il-dionigi/Circuit-Board-Design/blob/master/SchematicPictures) while screenshots of the pcb may be found [here](https://github.com/il-dionigi/Circuit-Board-Design/blob/master/BoardPictures).
